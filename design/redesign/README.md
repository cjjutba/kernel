# Redesign reference (KERNEL-274)

The redesign canvas from October 2026, saved so later work can check screens against it. Each `<Screen>.png` is a 1440x900 render of `canvas/<Screen>.dc.html`. For the surfaces listed below, these PNGs replace the matching `design/screens/` PNGs as the spec. Everything else still follows `design/screens/`.

Live canvas: https://claude.ai/artifact/WjL6TnLm7UfAGjYtXsQWZe

To redraw the PNGs after editing an artboard, run `node design/redesign/render.mjs [Screen ...]`. It fills each artboard's template from its default props and screenshots it with headless Chrome. Set `CHROME` if the browser isn't at the default macOS path.

## Color

- Linear's neutrals and hues stay: the same greys, `--add`, `--del` and `--merged`. New tokens cover only plan mode and the PR bands.
- **PR header.** Every state gets a band: grey for neutral, green for open and ready, red for anything to fix, violet for merged. The label, the link pill and the buttons take the band's tone. A busy button keeps the tone and dims, and the spinner only ever appears on the button.
- **Plan mode.** The composer gets a blue border and a glow from the bottom edge (`--plan`). Plan waiting uses the same blue, with Copy and Approve in a blue strip on top. There's no hatch and no label.
- **Amber (`--needs`).** It means "your turn": the waiting icon on sidebar rows and chat tabs, and the Inbox count.

## Screens

| PNG | Shows | App surface |
|---|---|---|
| `Main` | The app before the redesign, for comparison | |
| `Proposed` | Workspace with the Run tab open | `screens/workspace/Panels.tsx`, `pr/PrHeader.tsx`, `components/sidebar/` |
| `ProposedSetup` | Setup tab empty state | `Panels.tsx` (bottom panel) |
| `ProposedTerminal` | Terminal tab | `Panels.tsx` (bottom panel) |
| `TeamUpdate` | Team update cards in Rowan's chat | `screens/workspace/cards/TeamUpdateCard.tsx` |
| `AskRowan` | Ask Rowan popover, empty | `components/footer/QuickAsk.tsx` |
| `NewChat` | New chat empty state | `screens/workspace/Transcript.tsx` |
| `Composer` | Composer states side by side | `screens/workspace/composer/` |
| `PlanStates` | Plan mode and plan waiting, empty and typing | `composer/composer.css`, `cards/plan.tsx` |
| `PlanModeEmpty`, `PlanModeTyping` | Plan mode in Rowan's chat | `composer/composer.css` |
| `PlanWaiting`, `PlanWaitingTyping` | A plan waiting for approval | `cards/plan.tsx` (`PlanBar`, `PlanInline`) |
| `PrNoChanges` to `PrClosed` | One screen per PR state, in the order a PR moves through them | `pr/model.ts` (`headerView`), `pr/PrHeader.tsx`, `pr/pr.css` |

The PR screens cover No changes yet, No PR yet, Creating PR, Draft, Open, Checks running, Checks failed, Changes requested, Merge conflicts, Resolving, Ready to merge, Merging, Merged and Closed.

## Not built

The canvas draws a few things KERNEL-274 left out on purpose. Don't treat them as spec:

- The plan-mode button in the composer footer (the checklist icon). Plan mode is shown by the composer's color only, and ⇧Tab and the + menu still toggle it.
- The collapse arrow and the + for more terminals in the bottom panel.
- The close button in the Ask Rowan header. Escape and clicking outside close it.
- The centered composer on `NewChat`. The composer stays at the bottom, and only the title, subtitle and suggestions are redesigned.
- The plan strip's checklist icon. The app uses the clipboard (`plan`) icon the sidebar already shows for a plan to review.
- Sample copy on the canvas, such as chat text, issue titles and the Kernel notes for PR states the engine doesn't send.
